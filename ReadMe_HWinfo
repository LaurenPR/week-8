Homework for Week 8
Lauren Payne-Riley

Part I: Turf.js was originally used in my midterm to provide a count between a polygon and point data enclosed within.

Part II: Used Cluster Groups on Leaflet to modify the points on intial start-up 
(this ONLY runs on start-up, not when you click back to the first page. For the purposes of this 
exercies I thought that was fine to not modify the code to make it always show the clusters)



Please see Midterm submission for the relevant code :)
